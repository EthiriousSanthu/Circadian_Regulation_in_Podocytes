# Circadian Regulation in Podocytes

## Overview

The kidney plays a vital role in filtering blood and maintaining fluid and ion homeostasis. Approximately 90% of chronic kidney disease cases are linked to glomerular diseases, with the epithelial podocyte cell at the forefront of these pathological changes. Podocytes are specialised cells in the kidney that are terminally differentiated and essential for glomerular filtration. Recent research into circadian rhythms has highlighted the significance of the biological clock in regulating a wide array of podocytic genes. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that disturbances in circadian rhythm within podocytes can lead to alterations in the glomerular filtration rate and podocyte injury. Disruption of circadian clocks has detrimental effects on both the structure and function of podocytes. Changes in circadian rhythm can be quantified using the Circadian Rhythm Disruption (CRD) score, which may impact podocyte function.

In my study, I identified circadian genes from mouse RNA sequencing data utilizing the cglmm() function in R. I applied these genes to calculate CRD scores in human Xenium data, also in R. Subsequently, I conducted correlation analyses to investigate the relationships between CRD scores and podocyte damage scores (PDS), as well as age, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), and Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR).
